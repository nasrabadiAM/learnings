LiveData

لایو دیتا یک دیتاهولدر است.

Observabale بوده و می‌توانیم روی تغییرات آن Observe کنیم.

لایو‌دیتا Lifecycle aware است یعنی دیگر نیاز نیست مراقب مموری لیک باشیم.


LiveData
---

```

/**
 * LiveData is a data holder class that can be observed within a given lifecycle.
 * This means that an {@link Observer} can be added in a pair with a {@link LifecycleOwner}, and
 * this observer will be notified about modifications of the wrapped data only if the paired
 * LifecycleOwner is in active state. LifecycleOwner is considered as active, if its state is
 * {@link Lifecycle.State#STARTED} or {@link Lifecycle.State#RESUMED}. An observer added via
 * {@link #observeForever(Observer)} is considered as always active and thus will be always notified
 * about modifications. For those observers, you should manually call
 * {@link #removeObserver(Observer)}.
 *
 * <p> An observer added with a Lifecycle will be automatically removed if the corresponding
 * Lifecycle moves to {@link Lifecycle.State#DESTROYED} state. This is especially useful for
 * activities and fragments where they can safely observe LiveData and not worry about leaks:
 * they will be instantly unsubscribed when they are destroyed.
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition, LiveData has {@link LiveData#onActive()} and {@link LiveData#onInactive()} methods
 * to get notified when number of active {@link Observer}s change between 0 and 1.
 * This allows LiveData to release any heavy resources when it does not have any Observers that
 * are actively observing.
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to hold individual data fields of {@link ViewModel},
 * but can also be used for sharing data between different modules in your application
 * in a decoupled fashion.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of data hold by this instance
 * @see ViewModel
